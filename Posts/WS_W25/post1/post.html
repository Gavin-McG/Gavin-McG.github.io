      <div class="task" time="2h">Meeting W/ Directors</div>
      <p>
        Because our Project Dragonheart from the previous semester was being handed over to the production team, we had
        a meeting before the kickoff with the studio directors to establish what direction the game would be taken in,
        what was completed, what was left to be completed, and what tasks would exist for each studio department. There
        were certain aspects which hadn’t been completely established during our R&D phase.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="2h">Kickoff Meeting</div>
      <p>
        The kickoff meeting mostly consisted of ice-breakers and introductions to the projects. Most of the studio
        members who were returning already knew of the generaal idea of the project from our presentations and showcases
        from the previous semester. Those that were new were given a basic description of the project, knowing they’d
        become more accustomed as the project as the semester goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once general introductions and ice-breakers were finished people were each assigned their initial tasks for the
        semester. I was to work on a debug terminal, which would be useful for fellow programmers when debugging and
        testing their own features. This wasn't something that had been considered previously as it wasn't a priority
        with a team of only two programmers.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="3h">Debug Console</div>
      <p>
        Instead of creating a terminal from scratch, I used a existing package from a Github Repo that was suggested to
        me by Connor Chen. I believe that same package was used in the previous Studio project.
      </p>

      <p class="caption"><a href="https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityIngameDebugConsole">See Github Page</a></p>
      <p>
        Once the package was added to the project it was fairly simple to add individual features and commands. I bagan
        with a way to easily add any amount of individual or all resources. For the dungeon system I added a way to
        automatically hire either a team of a random party or a preset team with max stats. I also added a way to
        automatically win or lose a fight, which did take some adjusting to the fighting code to work correctly.
        Finally, as general utilities, I added a command to place a preset town with one of every building and a command
        to change the timescale of the game.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="30m">Call with Teammate</div>
      <p>
        One of my fellow programmers who was assigned to environmental game features needed to make use of the
        pathfinding system that I had created. I got onto a discord call with him to explain the system in more detail,
        including the general functionality, how to use it, and examples of how this system had already been applied in
        the project elsewhere.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="2.5h">Studio Meeting #2</div>
      <p>
        This meeting began relitively similar to the kickoff meeting. We began with another ice-breakers session of
        Jackbox games. After that, the people who had completed their previously assigned tasks were given new tasks. I
        was assgined to complete the contractor. The contractor wasn't extremely fleshed out design-wise so we discussed
        it a bit. We decided to do away with the quarry idea. Instead, it would just be for upgrading buildings.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="6.5h">Building Interfaces</div>
      <p>
        Looking at the working UI designs, the upgrade option would be a part of the "hover UI" functionality which is
        to be implemented. Thinking about how this would need to be implemented with the current upgrade system, it
        would need individual logic foreach building type, which seems clunky and inconvenient. I wanted to move the
        upgrade system, as well as other shared functionality between buildings, into interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were multiple goals I had for a new upgrade system. I wanted the upgrades of each building to be
        serialized within the inspector, which was currently not the case. I wanted the bulk of the upgrade logic to be
        confined within defualt implementation of the interface as to not bloat the Building scripts. I also wanted
        functions like accessing upgrades and the next upgrade to be easily accesible.
      </p>
      <div class="code" href="Scripts/IUpgradeable.cs"></div>
      <div class="code" href="Scripts/WizardTower.cs"></div>
      <p>
        I also wanted to implement interfaces for the buildings which produce resources and those which expand the town
        range. The use of which can both can be seen within the previous WizardTower.cs script. This change enabled the
        simplification of many of the building scripts and in the other scripts which reference this functionality.
      </p>

      <div class="task" time="2h">Studio Meeting #3</div>
      <p>
        This meeting was mostly just a worktime. I still had my work on the contractor to complete after working on the
        building interfaces, so I didn't need to be assigned any new tasks. I did spend some to complete a new section
        of the programming documentation to represent the changes made to the Buildings, the BuildingManager script, and
        the new interfaces.
