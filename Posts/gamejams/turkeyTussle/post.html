      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>
        Turkey Tussle is a solo project I created for the 2024 Shammy Jam. It is a local multiplayer game where 2
        players compete against each other in a sort of jousting competition between two out-of-control turkeys. All of
        the game models and visuals were created by me.
      </p>
      <p>
        In creating Turkey Tussle I used many techniques and strategies
        that I hadnâ€™t yet used in any formal projects. It was the first project which I used post-processing. It uses a
        custom shader which both pixelizes the game and creates outlines around objects. Learning how to implement the
        many transparent particles in the URP rendering system was also a learning experience. This project also
        utilizes the Unity animator system more than any of my previous projects, having fully rigged models and
        keyframe animations, as opposed to purely scripted animations.
