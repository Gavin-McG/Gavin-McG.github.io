      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>
        The World's Hardest Trip is a solo project I created for the 2024 Pumpkin Jam. It is inspired by the classic
        Flash game titled The World's hardest game, featuring a similar set of challenges and control system. This game
        is made unique by is interesting visuals and unique design approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approached creating this game with the self-adminiserted challenge of using as little assets & scene elements
        as possible within the Unity game engine. The final project only has 3 assets: a script, a shader, and a scene.
        The scene itself only has one camera object. All of the games visuals are displayed via a single post-processing
        shader and all of the level data is within the script's serializable variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunetally, this unique approach to game development resulted in a project that doesn't function as a web
        build. The project can be downloaded for Windows on
