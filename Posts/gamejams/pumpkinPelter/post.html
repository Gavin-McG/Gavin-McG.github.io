      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>
        Pumpkin Pelter was my solo submission for the wolverinesoft Mega jam in Fall 2023. The player must fend off
        magic haunted pumpkins using small pumpkins as throwable projectiles. It features 8 different waves of different
        enemies, each with different attack patterns, with the last wave being a final boss fight. The overall gameplay
        was roughly inspired by the boss fights featured in the super mario galaxy games.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the 3d models were created by me using blender. All animations and attack patterns are controlled and
        dictated via scripts. The grass uses compute shaders and gpu instancing to prevent it from having a significant
        performance impact. The sound effects were made using JSFXR and the music was taken from a free-to-use archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunetally, this project was created using an older version of Unity that isn't working for a web build. It
        can be downloaded for Windows on
        <a href="https://gavinmcg.itch.io/pumpkin-pelter">My Itch Page</a>.
