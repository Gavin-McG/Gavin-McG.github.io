      <p>
        One of the core components of the Quest system will be the Party Manager. This script manages the adventurers
        that the players have hired and contains the logic for sending them on quests, hiring new adventurers, and
        create new randomly generated adventurers. While most of the functions of this script will be dictated through
        UI that will be created later, the underlying logic can be designed now.
      </p>
      <p>
        First I created an Adventurer script which contains the adventurer class and several enumerators to represent
        different forms of information about the adventurer. The adventurerInfo is a scriptableObject which groups the
        face asset for the UI, the body asset for when the adventurer is travelling through the world, and the class of
        the adventurer so the art of each adventurer can be designed around a specific class.
      </p>
      <div class="code" href="Scripts/Adventurer.cs"></div>
      <p>
        The PartyManager manages an array of 4 adventurers. It provides public scripts for the Tavern to hire new
        adventurers and provides methods to dispatch the party to a dungeon of a specific name. It also stores many
        values I'd like to share between different UI pages such as the the colors. Something I'd like to note is that
        the version of the PartyManager script below is not how it was first written, but has been altered throughout
        the process of the UI design which I will describe later.
