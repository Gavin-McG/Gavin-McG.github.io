        <h1>Header #1</h1>
        <p>This is example text to show an example to the intended format of this blog. This post will only be listed until I make my first actual blog post, at which point it will be replaced. Below is an example image with an associated caption</p>

        <p class="caption">This is an example Image</p>

        <h1>Header #2</h1>
        <p>It may also be necessary for format certain content into lists. Of the top of my head, that could include potential features to impliment in the future, various bug fixes, lists of completed tasks, or various ideas for implimenting a certain feature. In any of those cases it would be for,atted into an unordered list as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>List Item #1</li>
            <li>List Item #2</li>
            <li>List Item #3</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When describing an order of events which took place, like describing the order of game events, it would be more fitting to use an ordered list. Those will appear as follows:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>This is the first thing that happens.</li>
            <li>This is the second.</li>
            <li>This is last.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</body>
