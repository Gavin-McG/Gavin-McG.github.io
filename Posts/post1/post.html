        <div class="task" time="2.5h">Weekly Meeting #1</div>
        <p>To kick off this week's meeting we began with some icebreakers. Shortly 
            following, a brief demo was given to introduce the basics of using Notion.
            It was a new software to me, but it was pretty easy to pick up on. A similar 
            demonstration was given to introduce Gitlab, at which point I cloned the existing 
            directory for project Sandcastle.</p>
        <p>The teams were the semester were announced. I was on R&D team #1 alongside Connor 
            Spears and Nadav Havilio. I was happy being on R&D, as I'm not too partial to 
            the strategy genre of project Sandcastle. We began the second part of the meeting 
            within our own groups. Us R&D teams were assigned to decide on a game genre and 
            spend the week doing research to disocver what makes a game within that genre 
            succesful.</p>

        <div class="task" time="1h">R&D Meeting (9/30/24)</div>
        <p>Our R&D group met on a discord call to establish the genre for the bame we would be 
            developing. The main ideas we discussed were platformer, fighting game, and management 
            simulator. We decided against platformer, as Wolverinesoft Studio had very recently 
            created a platformer game. During the previous weekly meeting Connor and I had tossed around the 
            idea of a managment simulator, which is where we as a group settled. We are leaning in the 
            direction of a fantasy/magic based game as it opens up many potential features 
            and ideas going forward. It also fits very well with Nedav's perferred art direction.</p>
        <p>Once we were decided on our genre, we moved on to establishing our tasks for the rest of the week. 
            We would need to research management simulator games. I suggested a particular emphasis on 
            what makes succesful games of this genre feel entertaining rather than monotonous. We 
            decided that we would meet again later in the week to consolodate our research and establish 
            more concrete ideas for the game's direction to bring to the next weekly meeting.
