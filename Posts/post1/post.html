        <div class="task" time="2.5h">Weekly Meeting #1</div>
        <p>To kick off this week's meeting we began with some icebreakers. Shortly 
            following, a brief demo was given to introduce the basics of using Notion.
            It was a new software to me, put it was pretty easy to pick up on. A similar 
            demonstration was given tointroduce Gitlab, at which point I cloned the existing 
            directory for project Sandcastle.</p>
        <p>The teams were the semester were announced. I was on R&D team #1 alongside Connor 
            Spears and Nadav Havilio. I was happy being on R&D, as I'm not too partial to 
            the strategy genre of project Sandcastle. We began the second part of the meeting 
            within our own groups. Us R&D teams were assigned to decide on a game genre and 
            spend the week doing research to disocver what makes a game within that genre 
            succesful.</p>
